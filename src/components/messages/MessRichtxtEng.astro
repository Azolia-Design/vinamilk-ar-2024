                Dear Valued Shareholders,
            </h2>

                    Vinamilk proudly hit its 47th year of development with the remarkable success. Reflecting on last year's performance, it is noteworthy that Vinamilk was able to maintain steady dividend payments and reasonable allocation of resources for sustainability commitments. Vinamilk’s brand value also climbed to USD 3 billion, up from USD 2.8 billion the previous year, cementing our spot as the No. 1 food brand in Vietnam and the 6th largest dairy brand in the world. These achievements are testament to Vinamilk's relentless efforts and commitment to offering the best values to shareholders and customers, fostering mutual growth with partners, and safeguarding the planet.

                </h3>
                <p class="txt txt-17 txt-inter">
                    In 2023, Vinamilk took a significant step forward by undergoing a bold rebranding initiative. This strategic move underscores the company's commitment to nurturing a culture of creativity and courage by way of challenging the status quo in response to the ever-evolving needs of consumers. To sustain the leading position in such a volatile market, the Company’s transformation goes beyond superficial changes. It encompasses fundamental restructuring through a series of strategic digital transformation projects currently being implemented across all operational aspects. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, Vinamilk aims to gain deeper customer insights, boost supply chain optimization, sharpen competitive edges, and streamline operational costs.

                    COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY
                </h3>
                <p class="txt txt-17 txt-inter">
                    Pioneering the sustainability journey for years, Vinamilk marked another significant milestone in 2023 with the launch of the action program “Pathways to Dairy Net Zero 2050”, coupled with a roadmap detailing 4 key pillars: Sustainable Agriculture, Green Production, Eco-friendly Logistics, and Sustainable Consumption. In addition, Vinamilk is the first dairy company in Vietnam to have a factory and farm-certified carbon neutrality according to the PAS 2060:2014 standard. This is thanks to the dual efforts in mitigating emissions in production and farming as well as maintaining green tree funds to absorb greenhouse gases over the years. Eventually, these achievements also serve as the first important building blocks in the pursuit of carbon neutrality by 2050.

                </h3>
                <p class="txt txt-17 txt-inter">
                    Vinamilk takes pride in maintaining its dividend payout policy with the significantly high ratios for shareholders. In 2023, the Company declared 3 interim dividends with a total value of VND 2,900 per share. At the 2024 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors is expected to propose a final dividend so that the total dividend for the full year is not lower than that of 2022. If approved, the dividend payout ratio to consolidated net profit after-tax attributed to the shareholders will likely continue to be over 90%, significantly higher than the minimum committed ratio of 50%.
